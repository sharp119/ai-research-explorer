   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd ai-research-explorer
   ```

2. Install dependencies
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn
   ```

## üé® Design Philosophy

This project aims to create an immersive, educational experience through:

- **Dynamic 3D Visualizations** - Making complex data relationships intuitive
- **Motion-Rich Interfaces** - Using animation to guide attention and create engagement
- **Intuitive Navigation** - Ensuring users can easily explore the content depth
- **Visually Distinct Sections** - Using color theory and spatial design to differentiate content areas
- **Accessibility Focus** - Ensuring content is accessible despite rich visual elements
- **Personal Progress** - Allowing users to track their learning journey
- **Resource Management** - Helping users organize and save valuable resources

## üì± Responsive Behavior

The application is designed to work across:
- Desktop (1200px+)
- Tablet (768px+)
- Mobile (< 768px)

3D visualizations gracefully degrade on smaller devices to maintain performance.

## üîÑ Data Management

Content is loaded from a structured JSON database, allowing for easy updates and extensions without changing the codebase. User progress and saved resources are stored in localStorage for persistence between sessions.
