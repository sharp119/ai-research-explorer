## üé® Design Philosophy

This project aims to create an immersive, educational experience through:

- **Dynamic 3D Visualizations** - Making complex data relationships intuitive
- **Motion-Rich Interfaces** - Using animation to guide attention and create engagement
- **Intuitive Navigation** - Ensuring users can easily explore the content depth
- **Visually Distinct Sections** - Using color theory and spatial design to differentiate content areas
- **Accessibility Focus** - Ensuring content is accessible despite rich visual elements

## üì± Responsive Behavior

The application is designed to work across:
- Desktop (1200px+)
- Tablet (768px+)
