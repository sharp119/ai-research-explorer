## How to Use
For developers looking to enhance this further:

1. The main component is in `src/pages/Resources.tsx`
2. CSS styles are in `src/index.css`
3. Data structure is defined in `src/types/index.ts`
4. The data source is in `public/ai_research_database.json`

The implementation leverages React's built-in features and adds react-icons for the icons without requiring additional dependencies.
